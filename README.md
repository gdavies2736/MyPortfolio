<h3> 1. Description </h3>
 
The purpose of this project was to create a portfolio to demonstrate my skills and talents to employers or anyone interested in understanding the front-end development skills I am capable of. When additional projects have been completed, they can then be added to or updated in the portfolio.

The portfolio will showcase these projects and have links to deployed web applications, which an employer would be able to visit.

Here are screenshots showing the landing page for my portfolio:

<h3>2. Issues </h3>

Having a design background, I knew roughly how I wanted my portfolio to look. I am a big fan of simplicity, which is a common design approach. A challenge I initially had with thinking about the code for this project, was how to group sections together. This took some thought to understand which containers different elements would need to sit within. 

 <br>

Adding to this, I needed to revisit the information I had learnt around flex-containers to understand how to structure the elements on a page. <br>

<h3>3. Usage</h3>

This project may be useful for anyone wishing to learn more about the front-end development projects I have completed including future employers.

The user can navigate to the different sections of the page by clicking on the top navigation.

It may also be useful for those learning how to build a portfolio using flex-box and understand more about:
<br>
1. HTML <br>
2. CSS <br>
3. Flex-box<br>
